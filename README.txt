Programming Assignment 1 - JAVA

The basic idea of this project was to introduce creation of linked lists and interfaces. This project was built using previous knowledge of JAVA such as the MVC model, reading/writing/manipulating text files, parsing data, and sorting data.
The basics of JAVA should already be understood when reading this code. 

Program Synopsis: 
A user modified address book which can add/delete/modify/display the contents. The user is prompted with a GUI with multiple selections. When the address book is modified with a person's entry (name, address, date, ect.), the contents are saved to a text file which can be displayed in order. 


MVC - model, view, controller idea was also introduced.

Model classes - Maintains the state and data that the application represents - holds the core of the application. If changes are made in the model, it updates all of its views. 

Controller class - This typically holds the use cases/main method. 

View classes - The user interface which displays information about the model to the user.
